# Go Network and System Layers Practice

This repository contains a collection of projects for learning and practicing Go with system and network layers. Each project is designed to showcase different concepts and techniques for working with low-level networking and system APIs.

## Implemented projects

- [tcpserver](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Emad/GoNetSysToolkit/tree/main/tcpserver): A simple TCP server that listens on port 8080 and returns an HTTP response to incoming connections.
- [udpserver](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Emad/GoNetSysToolkit/tree/main/udpserver): A simple UDP echo server that listens on port 8080 and echoes back any message it receives.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project you'd like to try. Each project is contained within its own directory, with its own set of instructions and documentation.

## Network in-progress projects

- [x] A simple TCP server that listens on port 8080 and returns an HTTP response to incoming connections.
- [x] A simple UDP echo server that listens on port 8080 and echoes back any message it receives.
- [ ] Implement a simple DNS server that resolves domain names to IP addresses
- [ ] Build a file transfer tool that uses FTP or SFTP protocols
- [ ] Create a proxy server that forwards requests to different servers based on a set of rules
- [ ] Build a network monitoring tool that displays real-time statistics about network traffic
- [ ] Implement a distributed system using Go's concurrency primitives like goroutines and channels

## System in-progress projects

- [ ] System Monitoring: Develop a system monitoring tool using Golang that can monitor the performance and health of the system by tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.

- [ ] Log Management: Develop a log management tool using Golang that can parse and analyze system logs generated by various applications running on the system. The tool can also provide real-time alerts for critical events and errors.

- [ ] Process Management: Develop a process management tool using Golang that can manage the lifecycle of system processes. The tool can start, stop, restart, and monitor system processes, and provide information about their resource usage and status.

- [ ] Configuration Management: Develop a configuration management tool using Golang that can automate the configuration and deployment of software on the system. The tool can read configuration files, deploy software packages, and manage system configurations across multiple machines.

- [ ] Backup and Restore: Develop a backup and restore tool using Golang that can backup and restore system data and configurations. The tool can also provide version control for backups and support remote backups for distributed systems.
