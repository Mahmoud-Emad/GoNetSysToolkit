# Go Network and System Layers Practice

This repository contains a collection of projects for learning and practicing Go with system and network layers. Each project is designed to showcase different concepts and techniques for working with low-level networking and system APIs.

## Project List

- [tcpserver](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Emad/GoNetSysToolkit/tree/main/tcpserver): A basic `Hello World` server that listens on a specified port and returns an HTTP response to incoming connections.
- [udpserver](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Emad/GoNetSysToolkit/tree/main/udpserver): A simple UDP echo server that listens on port 8080 and echoes back any message it receives.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project you'd like to try. Each project is contained within its own directory, with its own set of instructions and documentation.
